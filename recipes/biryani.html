    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of my most favourite Pakistani dish! Hyderabad Biryani has rich flavor, fluffy rice and delicous chicken.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg of rice</li>
        <li>400g of chicken</li>
        <li>4 Paprika</li>
        <li>4 Green Chillies</li>
        <li>4 Onions</li>
        <li>1 Whole Garlic</li>
        <li>some spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice throughly, at least 2-3 times, until water runs clear. Let it soke in water for at least 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Chop onions and garlic finely, and saute them in a large pot. Preferably use Ghee.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and the spices. Let them roast until fragant</li>
        <li>Finally add the Chillies and Paprika until they soften and get fragant.</li>
        <li>Add desired amount of water. Take care you dont add too much, since the rice has to soak it all up.</li>
        <li>After letting it simmer for about 1 hour, add the rice and let it cook until all the water is gone.</li>
        <li>Serve the Biryani with fresh Chapati and Youghurt.</li>
    </ol>
